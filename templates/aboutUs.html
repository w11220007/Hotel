                We believe that luxury is in the eye of the beholder. 
                <br><br>For some, it enriches their soul through a day
                at the spa, while others find it in cultural experiences
                that broaden the mind. Whatever your vision of luxury
                looks like, we're here to bring it to life.

                    <p class="description">
                    In 1970, the Frankfurt-based family-owned Steigenberger 
                    Hotel Group launched a reservation system to help luxury 
                    independent hotels in Europe and North America compete in 
                    an increasingly global market. Steigenberger Reservation 
                    Service, later known as SRS Hotels, was firmly established 
                    as a global player in the hospitality industry. <br><br>
                    Since that era, we have made great technological advancements 
                    in our reservation systems, rapidly grown our portfolio 
                    and rebranded to Worldhotels. Ever since the company's 
                    foundation more than 50 years ago, it has continued to 
                    embrace progress. However, throughout this time, the 
                    company's mission to provide access to independent hotels 
                    of luxury, character and distinction has never changed.
